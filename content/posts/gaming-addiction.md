# Preface 

Gaming has been part of every kids life, and is a concept that has existed pretty much forever. It is just unacceptable for someone to not like games, although I do have some eaxaamples, but I attribute it to them not finding the right game and rather being closted in the fear of addictions. Convincing themselves that they will get addicted to it immedietely upon initiation and robbing themlevs of the joy that comes with playing in fantasy worlds that are hard to imagine through the hard reality of life.
